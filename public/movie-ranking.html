    <h2>My top 4 movies for this year</h2>
<hr>
    <h3>TÃ r</h3>
        <p>Nice music and interesting thriller</p>
    <h3>Three Thousand Years of Longing</h3>
        <p>Quite interesting from the folklore perspective and nice animation</p>
    <h3>Red, White and Royal Blue</h3>
        <p>It has gays in it, which should suffice as an explanation, but quite modern also</p>
    <h3>Pride (2014)</h3>
        <p>It is so very wholesome and historically accurate, very educational</p>
